# Charity Shop Floor Plan Optimisation
## Project Overview
This project is aimed towards boosting a local charity shop's sales revenue, who have not had any previous data analysis performed. Following discussion with the shop's manager, we agreed that it would be of value to look into seasonal and monthly sales trends to observe whether we have the correct amount of stock displayed on the floor for particular categories throughout the year. The company has a vast amount of data but for this project we focus specifically on their space management reports. As a brief overview this data tells us the weekly sales revenue and quantity sold for each category and sub category of items as well as the amount of floor space they occupy. We provide insights and recommendations for the optimal floor plan for the amount of space each category should take up based on the previous three and a half years of data. The focus of this report will mainly be on the findings for September since the project was completed in August, therefore we can look to implement our first changes in September.

## Data Structure
We use the charity shop's space management entry data reports dating back to 27th March 2022 until 20th July 2025. Constructed from this dataset we also have two other datasets: optim bays and optim rev. These two additional datasets are the results of our optimisation of the floor plan and are used to display these findings in Power BI. Optim bays contains the predicted optimal and average observed number of bays each category occupies in the shop for each month and optim rev contains the predicted optimal revenue and average observed revenue for each month.
